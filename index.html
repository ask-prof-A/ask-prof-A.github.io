   <h2><A name="about me"><span style="color:black">About Me</span></A></h2>


<p>
Hi, my name is Dr. Aditya Mishra, the founding director of Your Academy. I hold a Master's degree from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. I have a unique blend of experience working in industry and academia.


</p>
<p>
As a scientist, I am fascinated by computer systems' ability to make this world a better place. I have extensively researched smart grids and cyber-physical systems to achieve sustainability. Over the last decade, I have published dozens of research papers and been cited in thousands of peer-reviewed research articles.


</p>
<p>
At the heart of it all, I'm a teacher with a passion for simplifying Computer Science and Professional formation. With over eight years of experience teaching technical courses to undergraduate and graduate students in science and engineering disciplines, I've guided countless students in their curriculum planning. I've also spearheaded numerous research and engineering projects, all with the aim of enhancing students' technical and professional development.


</p>
<p>
And here I am! Your Academy is here to help professionals, academics, and executives like you who believe it's the right time to turn their dreams into real life. This is no coincidence. I have thoroughly researched computer science, professional formation, and eastern philosophy for years before putting it all together into these courses. I invite you to join me on this journey!

</p>
<p>

May the force be with you!
